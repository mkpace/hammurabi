# A sample rule
# Note that the argument ("Thing person") is only necessary due to
# a bug in the Hammurabi Interactive interview. 
Tstr HelloWorld(Thing person) =
    "Hello, world!"

# Another sample rule
# This one actually makes use of the "person" argument.
Tstr HelloYou(Thing person) =
    "Hello, " + person.Id
