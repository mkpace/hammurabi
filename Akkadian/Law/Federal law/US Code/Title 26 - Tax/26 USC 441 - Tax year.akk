# Does not implement "52-53 week" tax years (can be done by overloading the method).
# Assumes that the tax year takes the number of the year of the greatest overlap.
# Assumes that the start month of a person's TY never changes.


#  Individual tax year
# Does not handle cases where start month changes in different tax years!
Tnum TaxYear(Thing p) =
    TemporalTaxYear(MonthTaxYearBegins(p))

  
# Tax year (temporal step function, starting in a given month)

    Time.IntervalsSince(TYStartDate.AddYears(-50),
                        TYStartDate.AddYears(50),
                        Time.IntervalType.Year,
                        DateTime.Now.Year - 50 + offset.ToInt)
                                       
    # Assumes that TY takes number of the year of with greatest overlap
