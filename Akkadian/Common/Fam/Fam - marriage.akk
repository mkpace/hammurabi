# Summary:      Basic family relationships relating to marriage
# Updated:      2012-08-02
# Author:       Michael Poulshock


##
Notes: These rules are not intuitive because they have to take into account
the possibility that facts related to marriage can be expressed in a number
of different ways:
  * IsMarried(p)
  * AreMarried(p,q)
  * SpousesOf(p)
  * MaritalStatus(p)
  * FamilyRelation(p,q)
  
TOOD: Could the rules below be simplified by defining IsMarried, AreMarried, and 
MaritalStatus in terms of SpousesOf (i.e. let the fact that conveys the most
information be at the bottom of the pile)?
