This is a bare-bones prototype of an interactive interview module for Hammurabi. 
It's meant to show how an interactive layer could be built on top of the 
Hammurabi Project knowledge base, in the hope that someone will come along and 
expand it into something robust, usable, and beautiful.

To grow this project into something worthwhile, here are some required features:

* Rich front-end that would allow users to input answers through standard controls
* Different controls for different kinds of questions (Tdates, Tbools, Tsets, etc.)
* Way to group questions on a page
* Way to put text messages on a page (and display them conditionally)
* Screen to allow users to view and change prior answers
* Mechanism for validating a user's answers
* Way to display coherent result messages at the end of the interview
* Additional types of inputs:
  * Single instances of legal entities (a special case of sets?)
  * Temporal versions of Booleans, dates, strings, etc.
* Allow user to say "don't know" (or "Uncertain" in Hammurabi)
* Ability to save/restore interview session
* Some sort of progress bar
* Database of metadata about Hammurabi relationships (see "Question templates.cs")

Nice-to-haves / advanced issues:

* Interview flow editor to override the "backwards chaining" mechanism when desired
* Way to hide/display questions conditionally
* Beware of the "back" button: Is it intended to retract facts? Or not?
* Orphaned facts problem: When a fact is retracted, all other facts that assume it 
  should also be retracted.  (E.g. if user retracts the fact that they're a female,
  the system should also retract the fact that they are pregnant.)

Note that Hammurabi Interactive is also used as a way to test the Akkadian rules.
